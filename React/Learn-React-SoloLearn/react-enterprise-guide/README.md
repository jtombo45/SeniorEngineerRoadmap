# React Enterprise Onboarding & Architecture Guide

> **You already learned the trees. This explains the forest, the ecosystem, and how people actually work in it.**

## What This Is

This folder is your **enterprise readiness guide** for React. It's not a tutorial—it's a practical orientation that helps you understand how React works *as a system* in real-world codebases.

Think of it as the missing piece between "I learned React features" and "I can survive my first week on a React team."

## Who This Is For

- **New hires** joining React projects
- Developers transitioning from **MVC frameworks** (Angular, Vue, traditional backends)
- Anyone who knows React *concepts* but feels lost in **enterprise codebases**
- Developers who want a **high-level mental model** of how React fits together

## How to Use This Guide

### Start Here

1. **Read this README** (you're doing it!)
2. **Start with** [`architecture-overview.md`](./architecture-overview.md) — understand React as a system
3. **Then** [`project-structure.md`](./project-structure.md) — learn to navigate real codebases
4. **Reference** the other files as needed when you encounter specific challenges

### Working With SoloLearn Notes

This guide **complements** the detailed SoloLearn course materials in:

- [`../Getting Started/`](../Getting%20Started/) — React basics and setup
- [`../Intro To React/`](../Intro%20To%20React/) — Components, props, state, lifecycle
- [`../Contact Manager/`](../Contact%20Manager/) — Practical project examples

**When to use what:**

- **This guide** → "How does React work as a system? How do I navigate a real codebase?"
- **SoloLearn folders** → "What is useState? How do I write a component? Deep dive on Redux."

Think of it this way:
- SoloLearn = **Learning the language**
- This guide = **Understanding the culture**

## Reading Order

### First Day on a React Project

1. [`architecture-overview.md`](./architecture-overview.md) — Get the big picture
2. [`project-structure.md`](./project-structure.md) — Find your way around
3. [`state-and-data-flow.md`](./state-and-data-flow.md) — Understand how data moves

### When You Hit Specific Problems

- **Forms feel confusing?** → [`forms-and-user-input.md`](./forms-and-user-input.md)
- **API calls everywhere?** → [`api-and-backend-integration.md`](./api-and-backend-integration.md)
- **Build errors?** → [`environment-and-configuration.md`](./environment-and-configuration.md)
- **Bugs you can't find?** → [`debugging-and-dev-workflow.md`](./debugging-and-dev-workflow.md)

### Quick Reference

- [`best-practices-cheat-sheet.md`](./best-practices-cheat-sheet.md) — Skimmable wisdom

## What This Guide Assumes

✅ You've seen React code before  
✅ You understand basic concepts (components, props, state)  
✅ You can read JavaScript/JSX  

❌ You don't need to be a React expert  
❌ You don't need to know Redux deeply  
❌ You don't need enterprise experience  

## Philosophy

This guide is written with one goal: **help you not feel lost on day one**.

It's:
- **Practical** — focused on what you'll actually encounter
- **High-level** — connects concepts, doesn't re-teach them
- **Confident** — "Here's how this actually works in real projects"
- **Supportive** — assumes you're smart, just need orientation

## Contributing

If you find gaps or outdated information, update it. This guide should evolve with how React is actually used in the wild.
